## Get first name

##### Your Task 📚:

Create a function called `getFirstNames` where it takes a nested array of names and returns just the first name of each array

##### Examples 😃:

```
getFirstNames([["Ahmed","Aisha","Amina"],["Jaamac","Khadijah","Layla"],["Mohamed","Ali"]]) ➞ ["Ahmed","Jaamac","Mohamed"]

```

Good Luck 😀
